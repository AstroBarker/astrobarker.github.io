Outreach
========

> "One that beareth a torch shadoweth oneself to give light to others."

* * *

- **[Astronomy on Tap][aot]**: 
  - As a graduate student, I have been an active participant in Astronomy on Tap, a public outreach event where scientists give public-level talks at a local bar.
  - I have given talks titled:
    - "The Evolution of Astronomy: From Light to Gravitational Waves" in Lansing, MI
    - "Exploring the Lives and Deaths of Stars through Poetry." in Lansing MI and Albuquerque, NM

- **[Saturday Science][saturday]**: 
  - As part of the University of Tennessee's [University Assisted Community Schools][uacs] program, 
  myself and other volunteers performed hands-on science activities with students at 
  Pond Gap Elementary, a local Title I elementary school in Knoxville, TN, for all 5 years of undergrad.

- **Society of Physics Students**: 
  - For all five years of undergrad, I was heavily involved with the University of Tennessee (UTK) 
    chapter of the Society of Physics Students.
  - This group was, and continues to be, dedicated to outreach. Activities included:
    - Monthly public science demonstrations in downtown Knoxville
    - Visits to schools and museums
    - Organization of regional conferences for undergraduates
    - Hosting events such as lunches with faculty
  - We were [recognized][spsrecog] by the national organization for our outreach efforts on multiple occasions.
  - One of our most popular events was a frozen [pumpkin drop][pumpkin] near Halloween!

- **More Outreach!**: 
  - I have volunteered and continue to volunteer with many other organizations, often including local schools.
  - Developed lesson plans and co-led activities for a semester-long after-school science club at Annoor Academy in Knoxville.
  - At Inskip Elementary, a local community school in Knoxville, I helped lead an after-school LEGO robotics club.
