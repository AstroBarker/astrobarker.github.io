<p>I am a (soon-to-be) first year Astronomy and Astrophysics Ph.D student at Michigan State University
working under <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/couch/">Sean Couch</a> as part of the SNAPhU research group.
I am also currently collaborating with <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/eirik-endeve?page=0">Eirik Endeve</a>
assisting with the development of the <em>thornado</em> supernova hydrodynamics code.</p>

<p>I obtained my B.S. in physics in 2019 from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville working
under Eirik Endeve and
<a href="https://www.jics.utk.edu/staff-member/mezzacappa-anthony-0.">Anthony Mezzacappa</a>
developing supernova hydrodynamics algorithms and studying the supernova explosion mechanism.</p>

<p>I am interested in stellar nucleosynthesis, the effects of nuclear physics
on the outcomes of core collapse, and the explosion mechanism of core collapse
supernovae.</p>

<p>Outside of research, Iâ€™m passionate about equitable STEM education and science outreach and
enjoy hiking and nature photography.</p>
