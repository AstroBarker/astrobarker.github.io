  abstract      = {Observations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) reveal a wealth of         information about the dynamics of the supernova ejecta and its         composition but very little direct information about the         progenitor. Constraining properties of the progenitor and the         explosion requires coupling the observations with a theoretical         model of the explosion. Here we begin with the CCSN simulations         of Couch et al., which use a nonparametric treatment of the         neutrino transport while also accounting for turbulence and         convection. In this work we use the SuperNova Explosion Code to         evolve the CCSN hydrodynamics to later times and compute         bolometric light curves. Focusing on Type IIP SNe (SNe IIP), we         then (1) directly compare the theoretical STIR explosions to         observations and (2) assess how properties of the progenitor's         core can be estimated from optical photometry in the plateau         phase alone. First, the distribution of plateau luminosities (L         $_{50}$) and ejecta velocities achieved by our simulations is         similar to the observed distributions. Second, we fit our models         to the light curves and velocity evolution of some well-observed         SNe. Third, we recover well-known correlations, as well as the         difficulty of connecting any one SN property to zero-age main-         sequence mass. Finally, we show that there is a usable, linear         correlation between iron core mass and L $_{50}$ such that         optical photometry alone of SNe IIP can give us insights into         the cores of massive stars. Illustrating this by application to         a few SNe, we find iron core masses of 1.3-1.5 M         $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ with typical errors of 0.05 M         $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.
