About Me

> "Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light" - Sarah Williams

* * *

I am a Metropolis computational physics postdoctoral fellow Los Alamos National Laboratory 
in the Computational Physics and Methods group.

My primary research interests are the explosion mechanisms of core-collapse supernovae,
understanding which stars explode as CCSNe, the origins of the heaviest elements, and 
the development of portable, scalable, open source scientific software. I am a lead developer of 
[phoebus][phoebus], a general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic code for relativistic astrophysics.

I am passionate about developing open source, community driven scientific software. 
I strongly believe that open source software makes for better code and, ultimately, better science. 
When possible, all of my code and data products will be made openly available.

During my PhD at Michigan State University as a NSF Graduate Research Fellow I worked with [Sean Couch][couch]
as part of the SNAPhU research group studying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). I produced among the 
first light curves of CCSNe from high-fidelity, neutrino-driven simulations and connected observable 
properties of type IIP supernovae to properties of the progenitor. I previously also collaborated with 
Eirik Endeve, Anthony Mezzacappa, and others developing the [thornado][thornado] 
supernova [radiation hydrodynamics code](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..253...21P/abstract).

I graduated with honors from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) in 2019 with double majors in 
physics and mathematics and a minor in astronomy. That same year I was named Chancellor’s Undergraduate 
Researcher of the Year for my exceptional academic record and research contributions. 
My research contributions were further recognized by the National Science Foundation through a NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

At UTK I worked with Eirik Endeve and Anthony Mezzacappa exploring the explosion mechanism of core-collapse 
supernovae and assisting with the development of the thornado radiation hydrodynamics code, 
on which my [senior thesis](https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_chanhonoproj/2292/) was based.

Outside of research, I’m passionate about equitable STEM education and science outreach. 
As an undergrad I worked with several elementary schools in the Knoxville area leading, organizing, 
and assiting with various after school science programs. I also frequently engaged the general 
public with science demonstrations. To recognize my outreach efforts, academic success, and research achievements, 
I was awarded a Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship Honorable Mention.
