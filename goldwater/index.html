        <h2 id="the-barry-goldwater-scholarship"><a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org">The Barry Goldwater Scholarship</a></h2>

<p>The Barry Goldwater Scholarship is one of the most prestigious awards in STEM
at the undergraduate level. You may apply in your sophomore or junior year
(or even fourth year, if you will take 5+ years to graduate), and the award gives up to
$7,500 for each of your remaining years. The <a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/steps-in-process/">application process</a>
is a little bit involved, but not too bad. The first step is to contact your
<a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/campus-representative-locator/">campus representative</a>.
This is who you will submit your application to and they will select some of the applicants
from your school to nominate as finalists for the award. At this point you will be able to
revise your application materials, hopefully with the help of your campus representative.
The application itself consists of three components: a research essay, short
answer questions, and background information including short research statements.
Below you can find my advice on each piece of the application
process, as well as why it’s worthwhile to apply, and <a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/application-tips/">here</a>
you can find application tips on the Goldwater website.</p>

<h3 id="research-essay">Research Essay</h3>
<p>This is a three page summary of your research and the largest part of the application.
If you have participated in multiple projects, you must choose one
to write about, although you get to very briefly discuss any other research
projects in another part of the application. If you haven’t done research yet,
you can still apply but instead will write about <em>proposed</em> research
(more on that later). I chose the following rough outline for my research essay</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Roughly 1/2 page for introduction. Big picture stuff. What are you interested in
and why is it important?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1.5 pages to talk about what you <strong>did</strong> in your project. Did you do field work?
Run experiments? Develop code? You need to focus very heavily on <strong>your contributions</strong>
to the project. If you have an easily digestible graph or illustration that
shows your results, that would be good to include.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 1/2 page for results and conclusions. Be brief. What did you find?
Why are these results important? Tie them to a bigger picture. If you’re
going to continue the work, explain what you’re going to do and why. Showing
that you understand the importance <em>and limitations</em> of your work and results
is important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>About 1/2 page for references. This isn’t so important, but you should have
a couple of references to key papers.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>When writing this, keep in mind that your reviewers will be scientists, but they
will probably not be experts in your field. Keep jargon to a minimum and try to
make it as accessible as possible. For this, I suggest having as many people
proofread it as possible, preferably people with a different background than you.</p>

<p>Also check out the official <a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/faqs-3/">FAQs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="short-answer-questions">Short Answer Questions</h3>
<p>This is where you can set yourself apart as a person. You are asked to answer
the following questions</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“In one or two sentences, describe your career goals and professional aspirations. (200 characters)”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Expand on the above brief statement to more fully describe your career goals and professional aspirations. Indicate which area(s) of mathematics, science or engineering you are considering pursuing in your research career and specify how your current academic program and your overall educational plans will assist you in achieving your career goals and professional aspirations. (3000 characters)”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Describe an activity or experience that has been important in helping shape or reinforce your desire to pursue a research career in science, mathematics or engineering. (1500 Characters)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“(Optional. Answering this question will depend on your personal experience.) Goldwater Scholars will be representative of the diverse economic, ethnic, racial and occupational backgrounds of families in the U.S. Describe any social and/or economic impacts you have personally experienced that have influenced your education – either positively or negatively – and describe how you dealt with them. (1500 Characters)”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The key in this section is to try to set yourself apart. How is your academic program
preparing you for your goals? Are you supplementing your coursework with another
major to better prepare yourself for your field? Anyone can say “My coursework in
<em>x</em> major is preparing me for graduate school in <em>x</em> field.” How is it doing that?
And how are you making it uniquely yours?</p>

<p>For the third question you get the chance to show your passion. Maybe it was
your first time in the lab, or your first time visualizing your data, or even
your first failure. You’re trying to show the reviewers why you love science.
Again, you want to be unique. The reviewers have to read a lot of applications,
so make them want to keep reading yours. And <strong>avoid clichés</strong>. I can’t stress
that enough – they only hurt your writing.</p>

<p>The final question is tricky and can be, in my opinion, a make-or-break question.
You want to explain why any parts of your application may be lacking, such as
your GPA. If you are facing or have faced hardships such as being a
first-generation college student, a member of an underrepresented minority, or
coming form a low-income family, this is the place to talk about it. Demonstrate
how these things have affected you and how you have overcame them. Although
the question is technically optional, I would advice against skipping it.</p>

<p>Although these are all different questions, try to link together an overarching narrative throughout.</p>

<h3 id="individual-research-statements">Individual Research Statements</h3>
<p>These are short abstract length summaries of your research projects. Like with
the research essay, focus in on what you contributed to the project, and avoid
overusing technical jargon.</p>

<h3 id="what-if-i-dont-have-research-experience">What if I Don’t Have Research Experience?</h3>
<p>If you don’t yet have research experience, you can still apply! The primary
difference is that your research essay must now become a <em>research proposal</em> where
you will write about research that you are going to do or want to do. If you are
applying for research programs for the coming summer or academic year, it
might be best to write about that project. The more concrete, the better. The
rest of the advice for the research essay still applies, with a little reframing.
I would keep the introduction the same, and then discuss what you <em>will do</em>.
Talk about the limitations of the work. You won’t have a proper results section,
but explain what results you might want or expect and why the results will be useful,
placing the proposed work in a larger context. <em>Why should someone care about
this research</em>?</p>

<p>You also have an additional short answer question to answer: “In the absence of formal research experience, describe any skills or accomplishments significant and relevant to this application (e.g., analytical, lab, presentation skills).”
Here, you might want to describe skills that you’ve obtained that would prepare
you for a research project. Maybe one of your classes included fieldwork, or programming
assignments, or labwork, or presentations, for example. Relate these skills
directly to the proposed work.</p>

<h3 id="letters-of-recommendation">Letters of Recommendation</h3>
<p>You have to choose three people to write letters of recommendation for you. For
this, and for all competitive applications, these people need to really <strong>know</strong>
you. You should send them your statements (drafts are fine), CV/resume, and make sure
they are familiar with your goals and research. The faculty mentor for the work you
write about in the research essay should be one of your writers. If possible,
it would be good to get another person who has worked with you in a professional setting
outside of the classroom, and one person who can speak to your abilities
as a student. Be sure to also send them the Goldwater’s
<a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/recommendation-tips/">recommender tips</a>
to give them an idea of how they should be writing your letters.</p>

<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<p>The campus deadline for sending in initial applications varies from school
to school, so you should contact your
<a href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/campus-representative-locator/">campus representative</a>
to determine your deadline. It will be somewhere in mid September to early January.
I met with my campus representative in early August and began working on an outline
and first drafts. Your exact workflow will depend on your campus deadline, but
give yourself as much time as possible to revise, revise, revise.</p>

<h3 id="why-apply">Why Apply?</h3>
<p>I found applying for the Goldwater to be an incredibly rewarding experience. If
you intend on going into a career in STEM, especially a career in academia,
writing applications like this is going to become commonplace, and learning
to write an effective application is a skill that is difficult to develop. Regardless
of whether or not you receive the award, the experience of applying will be invaluable
later on when applying for graduate fellowships such as the
<a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a> and
<a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962">The FORD Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship</a>.
All of this will be helpful for applying to graduate school, internships, or jobs.
After receiving an honorable mention for the Goldwater, in the following year I went on to receive a
graduate fellowship from Michigan State University, an honorable mention for the
FORD Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship, and ultimately a NSF Graduate
Research Fellowship.</p>
