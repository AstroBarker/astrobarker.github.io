								<p>I'm <strong>Brandon Barker</strong>, a first year Astronomy and Astrophysis graduate student and NSF Graduate Fellow at Michigan State University.</p>

								<p>I work with <a href="https://web.pa.msu.edu/people/couch/">Sean Couch</a> as part of the SNAPhU research group studying 
								<strong>core-collapse supernovae</strong>. My current work is on connecting observable properties of type IIP supernovae to properties of the progenitor's core.
								I am also currently collaborating with <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/eirik-endeve?page=0">Eirik Endeve</a>
								assisting with the development of the <a href="https://github.com/endeve/thornado"><em>thornado</em></a>
								supernova hydrodynamics code.</p>
								
								<p>I graduated with honors from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) in 2019 with double majors in 
								physics and mathematics and a minor in astronomy. That same year I was named <strong>Chancellor’s Undergraduate Researcher of the Year</strong> for my exceptional academic record and research contributions. My research contributions were further recognized 
								by the National Science Foundation through a <strong>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</strong>.</p>
								
								<p>My primary research interests are stellar nucleosynthesis, the explosion mechanisms of core-collapse 
								supernovae, galactic chemical evolution, and the effects of nuclear physics on the outcomes of core-collapse.
								At UTK I worked with Eirik Endeve and <a href="https://www.jics.utk.edu/staff-member/mezzacappa-anthony-0.">Anthony Mezzacappa</a> 
								exploring the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae and assisting with the development of the <em>thornado</em> hydrodynamics code, on which my <a href="https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_chanhonoproj/2292/">senior thesis</a> was based.</p>
								
								<p>Outside of research, I’m passionate about <strong>equitable STEM education and science outreach</strong>. As an undergrad 
								I worked with several elementary schools in the Knoxville area leading, organizing, and assiting with various after 
								school science programs. I also frequently engaged the general public with science demonstrations from the physics department. 
								I hope to continue to be involved in my community throughout graduate school.
								To recognize my outreach efforts, academic success, and research achievements, I was awarded a 
								<strong>Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship Honorable Mention.</strong></p>
