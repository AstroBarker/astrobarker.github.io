# Funded Research Experiences

Finding opportunities to engage in undergraduate research outside of your home institution is not always easy. 
I've put together a list of funded research experiences that I've encountered. Please let me know if any 
information is found to be outdated or incorrect, or if you have anything to add!

Many federally funded research programs do not provide support for undocumented students, 
creating an unnecessary barrier for these students. The following resources have compiled 
opportunities that are available to undocumented students in physics and other fields:

- [UndocuSTEM](http://www.matthewrcover.com/undocumented-in-stem.html)
- [REUFinder](https://www.reufinder.com)

My list here is certainly not comprehensive. For more information, you may also see, for example, the [GRADMAP list](https://gradmap.org).
