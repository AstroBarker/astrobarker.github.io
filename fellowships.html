									Graduate fellowships are competitive awards given to top students each year. They are usually given to students about to enter a graduate program (either graduating undergraduates 
									or students that took time off) and students in their first two years of their graduate programs. There are many fellowships out there, each having 
									a different focus and perks. Recipients of these awards receive higher stipends, lower teaching requirements, sometimes access to computational resources or 
									technology funds, and more. <a href="https://astrobites.org/">Astrobites</a> has compiled a 
									large <a href="https://astrobites.org/2018/04/27/list-of-major-us-fellowships-for-astronomy-students/">list</a> of such fellowships 
									available to astronomy students. Below I share a few thoughts and resources from my experienes applying to graduate fellowships.
									At the end of the day, these fellowships are high competitive, but even more so stochastic. One application could get great marks with one set 
									of reviewers but not with a different set. Not getting one of these awards doesn't reflect on your potential as a researcher.

								<h3><a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a></h3> 
								</ul>

									<p>
										The NSF GRFP is one of the largest and most prestigious fellowships of its kind, providing three years of support, XSEDE 
										computing resources, and opportunities for funding for research travel. Students may apply for this as they are applying to 
										graduate programs (such as senior undergraduates) <b>and once</b> during their first <b>or</b> second year of their graduate program.
										There is a wealth of advice out there on preparing NSF GRFP applications and I can’t
										really do it justice. The best resource for me was Mallory Ladd’s <a href="http://www.malloryladd.com/nsf-grfp-advice.html">site</a>.
										<b>She covers it all.</b> Also useful is Alex Lang’s <a href="https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship">site</a>. There’s a huge
										list of essays here that may be helpful -- I highly encourage reading winning (and losing!) essays in your field to see 
										what did and did not work.
										I applied in October 2018 as a senior undergraduate and was awarded the fellowship in April. My application 
										materials and reviewer feedback can be found below. You can also find a
										<a href="https://carlnotsagan.github.io/fellowships/nsf_grfp/template_dir.zip">template directory</a>
										with LaTeX files that comply with proposal formatting guidelines (as of October 2018) courtesy of
										<a href="https://carlnotsagan.github.io">Carl Fields</a>. Feel free to contact me if you have
										any other questions!

								<h3><a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_171962">The FORD Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship</a></h3>
								</ul>
											
									<p>
									The FORD differs from the NSF in the emphasis that is placed on your potential as a future
									educator. Much of the previous advice for the NSF GRFP applies here as well, though
									some extra thought should be given in choosing your letter writers to ensure that
									they can properly address the criteria relevant for the FORD. It’s fairly straightforward
									to adapt an NSF proposal into a FORD proposal, just make sure that you address all
									of the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_166320">points</a> that they outline.
									Also check out Carl Field’s <a href="https://carlnotsagan.github.io/resources/">page</a> for his advice and essays!
									I applied in December 2018 and received an an honorable mention in March.
									My application materials and results are available below.</p>
