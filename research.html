									<h3>Constraining the Core Structure of Turbulence-aided Neutrino-driven Core-collapse Supernovae</h3>
										<p>Observations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) reveal a wealth of information about the dynamics of the supernova ejecta and composition, 
											for example, but tell little of the progenitor star without invoking a theoretical model. Until recently, one dimensional (1D) theoretical 
											CCSN models did not include a robust treatment of the core physics. We use a new model for driving turbulence-aided neutrino-driven core-collapse 
											supernovae in 1D which contains a high fidelity treatment of the neutrino and proto-neutron star physics while also accounting for turbulent and 
											convective energy. With this, we correlate observable properties of the light curves obtained from our model such as plateau luminosity and 
											photospheric velocity with properties of the core structure of the supernova such as the core compactness parameter. This will allow for properties 
											of the core structure of the progenitor stars to be estimated using easily-observed quantities from the light curves. Moreover, we present a 
											comparison of our population of type IIP supernovae to observed type IIP supernovae for which archival pre-supernovae data are available.</p>

									<h3>Equation of State Dependence of Core-Collapse Supernova Observables</h3>
										<p>The outcomes of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations can depend sensitively on the 
												nuclear phsyics of dense matter through the equation of state (EOS). In the simulation of core-collapse supernovae, 
												the EOS of nuclear matter is included through phenomological models and encoded in an EOS table for 
												use in our simulations as a relationship between the thermodyanmical variables. Due to 
												limitations in our understadning and in computational feasibility, there are many different
												models for the nuclear force resulting in many different tables that we may include in our simulations.
												Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how different EOS tables affect the
												outcome of core collapse is crucial to our ability to make predictions.
												1D CCSN simulations are ideal tools for understanding this sensitivity, as we
												can run thousands of 1D simulations to truly explore the parameter space in a
												meaningful way. Using a new model for creating physical explosions in 1D,
												I explored the sensitivity of
												CCSNe to variations in input nuclear physics by performing a population study using 
												nine open source EOS tables and 138 progenitor stars with ZAMS masses ranging from 9 to 
												120 solar masses.
												I tested the sensitivities of the observable signals to the nuclear
												equation of state and explored correlations of the signals with fundamental
												nuclear physics quantities, such as the symmetry energy and effective nucleon mass.</p>
												
												<p>I will be continuing this work with a different set of EOS tables reflecting 
												a wide range of key parameters with a larger set of progenitor stars, so stay tuned 
												for updates!</p>

									<h3>Supernova Hydrodynamics</h3>

										<p>It is by now well understood that hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in
												CCSNe. Turbulence, convection, and other hydrodynamic instabilities all
												play pivotal roles in driving the explosion. It is important, then, that
												the governing hydrodynamic equations are solved accurately and efficiently.
												I am assisting in the development of a new hydrodynamics code -- the toolkit for high-order
												neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics (<a href="https://github.com/endeve/thornado"><em>thornado</em></a>) -- 
												for CCSN simulations and related problems utilizing a spatial
												discretization based on the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. My interests are in 
												adapting the implementation in <em>thornado</em> to work with a tabulated nuclear
												matter equation of state (EoS). Moreover, I have implemented characteristic slope
												limiting (with a tabulated EoS), as this has been shown to be more effective than limiting on the
												conserved variables.</p>
												
												<p>An initial <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1225/1/012014">methods paper</a> 
												has been published, and more work on the nuclear EoS is in progress, so stay tuned!</p>

									<h3>Prospects for High Energy Follow-up Studies of Gravitational Wave Transients</h3>
										<p>Many of the most violent and energetic events
												in the cosmos, in particular the merger of compact objects and core collapse
												supernovae, are sources of gravitational waves and are also believed to be
												connected with Gamma Ray Bursts. Joint observations of electromagnetic and
												gravitational wave signals will provide an ideal opportunity to study the
												physics of these transient events and their progenitors. In particular,
												gamma ray observatories such as Fermi, coupled with precise sky localization,
												will be crucial to observe the high energy electromagnetic counterparts to
												gravitational wave signals. We constructed joint binary neutron star and
												gamma ray burst detection rate estimates using an analysis pipeline and
												report on the results of this analysis. Moreover, I extended the analysis to 
												include a catalog of real galaxies appropriate for such a follow-up study 
												(the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05709">GLADE Catalog</a>).</p>

									<h3>Other Research</h3>
										<p><b>The nature of supernova shock revival:</b> After the onset of core collapse, the shock 
										that is responsible for tearing the star apart and driving the explosion runs out of energy and 
										stalls. The exact nature of how the shock is revived is still a matter of active research. I developed 
										data analysis tools to investigate the relative contributions of neutrino driven convection and 
										the standing accretion shock instability to shock revival. </p>

									<p><b>Construction of a Vacuum Suitcase: </b> For one summer, I worked in an experimental 
										condensed matter lab. In addition to helping run a few experiments and calibrate a 
										new instrument, I built a portable vacuum chamber for safely moving samples between instruments.</p>
